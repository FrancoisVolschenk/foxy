A minimal, configuration-driven, hyper-extendible Rust HTTP proxy library.

## Features

- üõ£Ô∏è **Powerful Routing**: Predicate-based routing with path patterns, HTTP methods, headers, and query matching
- üîÑ **Flexible Filters**: Pre and post-processing filters for request/response modification
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Superpowers**: Layered configuration from files and environment variables
- üåê **Fine-grained Control**: Route-specific filter chains for precise request handling
- üîí **Pluggable Security Chain** ‚Äì configurable, provider-based request authentication with built-in providers
- üöÄ **Modern Async Architecture**: Built on Tokio and Hyper for high performance
- üì¶ **Lightweight Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies for core functionality
- üß© **Highly Extensible**: Custom predicates, filters *and* security providers via simple traits

## Quickstart

### Run the basic proxy example

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johan-steffens/foxy.git
cd foxy
cargo run --example basic-proxy
```

### Run it in your code

Add Foxy as a dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file
```toml
[dependencies]
foxy-io = "..."
```

Build an instance and start the server.

```rust
use foxy::Foxy;

// Create a new Foxy instance with layered configuration
let foxy = Foxy::loader()
    .with_env_vars()                  // Environment variables (highest priority)
    .with_config_file("config.toml")  // File-based config (medium priority)
    .with_config_file("defaults.toml") // Defaults (lowest priority)
    .build().await?;

// Start the proxy server and wait for it to complete
foxy.start().await?;
```

## Core Principles

- **Predictable Routing**: Predicate-based matching with clear priorities determines how requests are routed
- **Configurable Processing**: Route-specific and global filters for request/response modification
- **Extensibility**: Trait-based design enables custom predicates and filters
- **Configuration-Driven**: All behavior controlled via flexible configuration with sensible defaults

## Configuration

Foxy's power comes from its rich configuration system. Here's a brief overview:

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "id": "api-route",
      "target": "https://api.example.com",
      "filters": [
        {
          "type": "path_rewrite",
          "config": {
            "pattern": "^/api/(.*)$",
            "replacement": "/v2/$1"
          }
        }
      ],
      "predicates": [
        {
          "type_": "path",
          "config": {
            "pattern": "/api/*"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For detailed information on all configuration options, see the [Configuration Guide](./CONFIGURATION.md).

### Configuration Sources

Foxy supports multiple configuration sources with priority order:

```rust
// Build a layered configuration
let foxy = Foxy::loader()
    .with_env_vars()                   // First priority
    .with_config_file("config.json")   // Second priority
    .build().await?;
```

Example: `FOXY_SERVER_PORT=8080` ‚Üí `server.port`

### Enabling security

Add a `security_chain` with a configured provider to your proxy configuration:

```jsonc
{
  "proxy": {
    "security_chain": [
      {
        "type": "oidc",
        "config": {
          "issuer-uri": "https://id.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration",
          "aud": "my-api",
          "bypass-routes": [
            { "methods": ["GET"], "path": "/health" }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

That‚Äôs it ‚Äî requests hitting `/api/**` will be validated against the IDP while `/health` remains public.
Full configuration examples can be found in the [Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md).

## Streaming bodies

* Foxy proxies **request and response bodies as streams** end-to-end to ensure there's no full body buffering in memory.
    * Large uploads/downloads back-pressure correctly.
    * Memory usage is bound only by socket buffers.

### Detailed timing metrics

* Foxy records and logs three high-resolution latencies on every call  
  (DEBUG level):

`[timing] <METHOD> <PATH> -> <STATUS> | total=<X> upstream=<Y> internal=<Z>`

| field      | description                                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **total**  | wall-clock time from first byte in to last byte out        |
| **upstream** | time spent awaiting the target server                    |
| **internal** | proxy-side routing / filtering / logging (total ‚àí upstream) |

### Request and Response body logging

* `LoggingFilter` peeks and logs the first 1 000 bytes/characters of every
  request and response body (UTF-8-lossy).  
* Binary or very large payloads are safe‚Äîthe remainder of the stream is forwarded
  untouched.
* **Please note:** enabling request and response logging will introduce additional 
  latency to your calls.
